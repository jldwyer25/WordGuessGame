# WordGuessGame

A word guess game I wrote for my coding bootcamp. It's a simple theme, around my favorite thing: food. 

Press a key to start this app. There's a chance of 6 different words, good luck!

We made this in one of the first few weeks to help illustrate the usefulness of javascript. It was challenging because I couldn't understand how to make the individual functions call and check upon themselves, until I built them as objects. 

Enjoy my game, order some food.
